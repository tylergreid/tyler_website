:::{#me}

Hello! I'm a master's student at UNH. I'm currently conducting buckwheat research with the goal of increasing our understanding of the crop so its growth can be optimized. I'm hoping to also create new Tartary buckwheat varieties that can be released to farms in New England.

## Goals
My goal is to become a coder that is 10% as good as Faith!

## Education
I graduated from North Carolina State University with a degree in Biology in 2023.

## Experience
I worked as a research technician for two years in a cotton genetics and breeding laboratory. My work included supporting breeding efforts, conducting field work such as planting and harvesting, and managing plant growth in controlled-environment settings.
